Fashion Store Management System
This is a text-based application designed to streamline the management of clothing product information in a fashion store. The application allows users to perform essential operations such as displaying, adding, updating, and deleting clothing data.
The project was developed as a hands-on implementation of Python programming skills, showcasing the ability to create functional and efficient mini-projects.

The Fashion Store Management System was chosen to meet the essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) feature requirements, making it a comprehensive solution for managing store inventory.

Key Features:
- Clothing Data Management: Includes fields such as Item Code, Name, Category, Stock, and Price.
- CREATE: Add new clothing data based on the available columns.
- READ: Display data in three options: all clothing items, items filtered by code, or items filtered by category (Men/Women/Kids).
- UPDATE: Modify data by selecting the item code and updating specific fields such as Item Code, Name, Category, Stock, or Price.
- DELETE: Remove clothing data based on the selected item code.

This project demonstrates strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to build structured applications using Python. It reflects a solid understanding of CRUD operations and object-oriented programming principles.
